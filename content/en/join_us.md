___We need members in order to be listed for elections!___ ðŸ—³
* For the 2023 NSW Election, we need 750 members by mid-November 2021. Join through [this form](https://dochub.com/nonhuman-party-info/275eAYrVo6kg8NEKzXnBNQ/declaration-of-party-membership-pdf?dt=Qaefq5PPzguWMy_qy9X1).
* For the 2022 Victorian Election, we need 500 members by March 2022. Join through [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScbl-EKn5Fb4-zaVCDVDMei9D9ZBJm3uB8VFRFfkErcapGcEA/viewform?usp=sf_link)

When we submit these forms to the state electoral commission, they'll check if your details are correct; and if they're not, then we won't get approved ðŸ™€.

The Non-Human Party promises that the information on these forms will never be shared with anyone besides the electoral commission; and with our [Registered Officers](https://www.elections.nsw.gov.au/Political-participants/Political-parties/Register-a-party) in the relevant state.


## Why should IÂ join?
Even if you're not 100% likely to vote for the party, by helping us to get listed, it'll allow us to run a _real campaign_ for election. We'll have a seat at the table and will be able to shape the discourse around whether Australian governments have been neglecting the advances in technology; and the multitude of biological systems interacting with our human-built civilisation.

Even if we don't win a seat in parliament, if we can have enough influence on the public mindset, so that the lawyers and career politicians elected from the other parties can no longer avoid the realisation that Australia's underwhelming tech adoption is a _crisis_ for our society (especially our economy) and for the rest of the diverse biology that inhabits our continent.

Our society is structured only to serve corporations; goverments; and humans who are already alive right now.

Please keep in mind that 99% of Australians are not going to join a party, yet they'll still complain how nothing ever really changes. Please join us and help ensure that there are at least some new ideas floating around during the election.

## How much does it cost to join?
Nothing; it's free.

In due course, there'll be a way to donate if you like, in a way that satisfies the government's funding rules.

## Do IÂ have to drink the Kool-Aid?

Drinking the Kool-Aid is done on an honour system. We should clarify though, the __rules for party membership__:
* You must have a generally optimistic view of computing. Has the Internet been beneficial to society for instance?
* You must have some concern for other forms of life in our solar system, not just homo sapiens. Is it a bad thing if we kill some koalas in a tree, then chop it down and sell it as chipboard for a temporary wall?

### NSW Rules
* One of these two rules must apply (as per [ðŸ”—](https://www.elections.nsw.gov.au/Political-participants/Political-parties/Register-a-party)):
    * You must be at least 16 years old, an Australian citizen, and have lived at your present address for at least one month (bad luck to anyone without an address!)
    * You must be a British subject who is not an Australian citizen, but who was enrolled to vote on 25 January 1984; and who has lived at their current address for at least one month.
