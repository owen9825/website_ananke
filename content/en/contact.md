Feel free to reach out and discuss ideas about the creation of a more harmonious society.

If you'd like to become involved in the party, this would be very much appreciated. Although Owen will be running for election in NSW in 2023, there are other jurisdictions that would be logical places for candidates. In the US for instance, many counties have elections for sheriffs.

If you're interested in livening up your media publication with some alternative political ideas, that's also feasible âˆ’ Owen would probably be happy to participate in an interview or opinion article.
