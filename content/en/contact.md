Feel free to reach out and discuss ideas about the creation of a more harmonious society.

If you'd like to become involved in the party, this would be very much appreciated. Although we're currently accepting members in NSW and Victoria, there are other jurisdictions that would be logical places for candidates. In the US for instance, many counties have elections for sheriffs; and in Nevada, [companies are allowed to create their own counties](https://apnews.com/article/legislature-legislation-local-governments-nevada-economy-2fa79128a7bf41073c1e9102e8a0e5f0).
