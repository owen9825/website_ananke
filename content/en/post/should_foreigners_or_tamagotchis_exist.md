Have you ever thought that Tamagotchis deserved more rights than a photograph of a child?

In this video, we explore:
* How some existing non-human entities are missing out on rights
* How non-human entities relate to foreigners
* How society could benefit from more deliberate thought being applied to deciding who should actually exist

Foreigners are compared to non-humans as a way of relating to the similarities in their existence.

We explore some case studies about workplace safety; the popularity of pets; and the legalities of which animals you can kill.

The solutions discussed in this video relate closely to what's discussed in [Let Robot Overlords Inspect Your Butt](robots_inspect_your_butt).
