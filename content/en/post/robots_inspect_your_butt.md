As a consumer of food; has it ever occurred to you that despite the great power of government; and its involvement in the food supply; _there are still black markets for food?_

In this video, we explore how insufficient government insight or even involvement in the food supply is leading to sub-optimal outcomes for human health, animal rights and environmental protection. We see how there are potential solutions, including blockchains and anal probes.

The current state of affairs is blamed on dated ideologies of human superiority and a general aversion to technology, which I concede is a common theme of the party.

The benefits here are pitched as enhancing our physiology and cognition, expanding the potential of ourselves and our "nation" (see [Nationality As A Service](nationality_as_a_service)).

Case studies include Charles Darwin; wild horses; and strawberries with needles.
