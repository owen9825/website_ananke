# Why I'm voting Fusion

* Shady business deals hate having a light shone on them; they hate transparency.
The Liberals claim to avo
>They are examples of a prime minister making decisions in line with his underlying belief that people should look after themselves and that, as much as possible, the private sector should do what we have traditionally understood governments to do in these circumstances, and that if “the market” fails to step in, then, oh well, individuals, families, communities will just have to take care of themselves." − https://tdunlop.substack.com/p/the-end-of-government-as-we-know?s=r&utm_medium=web

Mostly my point of view, as the market is inherently more democratic, but the government should be guiding us through. It shouldn't be a mob that gets out of control. Governments should be actively facilitating markets to spot gaps and to spot collusion. Governments can guide the flow of capital and can guide their citizens in making life decisions that will pay off. Governments have a different set of incentives to corporations − more than any other entity, it's governments that have an interest in you staying happy, healthy and productive. If they diverge in this alignment, then you can always vote in candidates who will put things back on track. If we look at the vested interests of the Liberal and National Parties, then it's hard to get past "self interest" as the reason for most of their actions.

They talk about creating a strong economy, yet they fundamentally misunderstand how the Internet works. During the ridiculous debates around Google and Facebook paying just to link to news sites, nobody ever mentioned the fact that if these news sites really didn't like what Google was doing, they could just change their robots.txt page to tell Google to stop indexing their content.

The fact that DuckDuckGo was immune from the rules hints at the proper solution to the fiasco − wherever Internet services have proliferated to the extent that they become critical parts of modern life, then it's probably the case that the service should have been run as a public commons, without the risk of misaligned incentives.

## Why Unions are Suboptimal
* In the US, the fact that healthcare is tied to employment leads to a less dynamic economy. People are too reluctant to switch jobs.
* Complaining about Uber and Lyft not classing people as workers. All the risk of maintaining a vehicle is borne by the drivers, but how do you think a company car would be treated? I think that it's a good thing, being able to encourage entrepreneurism and ensuring people have aligned incentives. People should be more dependent on shares than on wages. Look at how many large companies are useless. Price's law.

* Giving subsidies to eg Holden

Complaining about executive salaries − why don't you become an executive yourself?

* In [this interview](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2NsC4KxVpHWJ437RnA0ZNo) (at 34:50), Liz Shuler, the president of the AFLCIO (a collection of unions) explains her opposition to the "Green New Deal", on the grounds that "it shouldn't be a choice between the economy and good-paying jobs". She's been associated with the electrical workers' union. "There are so many ways we reduce our carbon footprint; and the emphasis has to be not just on electricity emissions − it has to be on transportation emissions; it has to be on how we manufacture; but also do it in a way that helps working people make that transition and make sure that the jobs we're creating … are **good, union jobs**" She laments that the "renewable energy jobs" are jobs with "no benefits" (to Americans, this means no health insurance). I think that more than ever, we see here the problems in the American vocabulary, where "benefits" of a job don't include such things as satisfaction; a sense of purpose; or sense of morality. You can be an active participant in burning the planet, but that's fine, because the most comparable job for you personally, seems on one measure, like it wouldn't be as good for you.

I discuss in [Embraving Evil Technology]() how modern citizens have never in their whole lives shed a tear for the downfall of the horse and carriage industry when it was replaced by automobiles; and that we shouldn't let selfishness amongst a few current people get in the way of the greater good. These people blockading environmental progress have blood on their hands, whenever there is a flood; whenever there is a bushfire; whenever there is a hurricane.

Unions getting in the way of firing incompetent or lazy workers

Job safety leads to large, bloated companies that are anathema to innovation. I recall angel investor [David S. Rose](http://www.davidsrose.com/) making a great point, that it's a perfect time for a startup in this day and age, because if you fail, you can only lose 100%. If your company fails, you're not forced to dip further into your life savings; and you're not going to be indebted for life, paying back millions of dollars to investors who knowingly took a gamble.

What's holding back startups and innovation now is mainly cultural − Australia is more risk-averse than the US; and if someone's startup fails to take over the world, then unlike Americans who might see it as an over-eager life-learning; Australians seem more prone to view it as "serves them right for getting too carried away with themselves."

In a large bureaucracy, if I take a risk and lose, I might get fired and the company will hang its head in shame. If the bet works, the company will be praised, but I'm unlikely to have any equity at all in an Australian company, so the upside risk for me is maybe a $10k bonus and a pat on the back.

[Price's Law](https://dariusforoux.com/prices-law/) was discovered in the context of people publishing scientific papers, but it holds in other areas of creative output too. It finds that 50% of the output from a population is produced by the square root of the population. So as a company grows from 25 to 100 staff, the *productive population* has only grown from 5 to 10. Even without any other reason, this principle should be enough to highlight why it's so beneficial for parties such as the Fusion Party to be encouraging tech startups and innovation. From [The Innovator's Dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma) to Elon Musk's biography, we've seen that **it's startups, not incumbent companies, where society-changing innovation takes place.**

Australia *can be* a beautiful, harmonious place to live, where new perspectives and multicultural experiences coexist. It can be a perfect place for world-changing startups to be born. The Fusion Party 

## Environmentalism

I said that the unions have misaligned incentives; and I feel that the alignment of incentives for the Fusion Party are most clearly demonstrated by the facts that they support reframing *aging* as a *disease*; and that the candidates already skew younger than their incumbent counterparts. The Fusion Party candidates want to create a future that they can live in.

## High-Speed Rail
Killing airline industry. Don't yet mention Unabomber. Does Corey Doctorow discuss it at all?

* The Labor Party has historically stood up for workers' rights, but their approach has always been more interventionary − rules and regulations, as opposed to letting the data speak for itself. Where there are more transparent markets, people are able ot better negotiate on their own, without the need for minimum wages or pricing caps. I don't believe that people really want to be treated as helpless babies in need of an intimidating big brother to run their life for them.

* Germany turned away from nuclear power and now they're reliant on Russian oil. [29% of Europe's natural gas came from Russia, in 2020](https://www.wsj.com/articles/energy-dependence-ties-europes-hands-in-u-s-russia-crisis-11642069805?mod=article_inline)

* The major parties are so uninspired and have such a ho-hum view for progress in Australia. If you choose to keep playing it safe, you leave all the innovation to someone else and the best you can do is ride off their coattails. It's not safe; it's setting yourself up to be someone's bitch. In our case, it's America:
	* Joe Biden forgetting Scott Morrison's name

* People aren't excited about Labor:
> Australia's just as bad. Our Liberal (actually fairly conservative) government is pretty blatantly corrupt, owned by Murdoch media and led by an incompetent idiot who can't keep his own foot out of his mouth for a week. His 2IC is a huge part of said corruption and is about as slimy as it gets for our politicians.

Our Labor party, by contrast, is quietly corrupt and their leader appears on headlines about once a fortnight. They also quietly approve the less egregious shit the Liberal party pushes through the House and Senate, have very few genuinely different policies to the Liberal party and likely won't effect genuine change even if they do form a government in our upcoming election. About the only thing really going for them imo is that they have a rocky relationship with Murdoch media so they might finally do the sorely, sorely needed royal inquiry into media control in Australia.

It's a shit choice but I'm still going to be cheering when this current government is gone. It's a shame that our more conservative party will happily form a coalition with blatant racists but our slightly more liberal party refuses to touch the Greens with a pole.

## Foreign Policy
Especially under the sway of the Liberal Party, Australia has been almost blindly following the military positions of the United States. It seems that there is an expectation by Australian leaders that this goodwill would be returned, should Australia ever need military help; and in fact, the recent Liberal government has seemed to have a position of front-running the US in its arguments. When Australia demanded an investigation into the origins of COVID for instance, this made it the first nation to officially voice the proposal; and there was presumably the feeling that other nations would have our back, in this fight.

Although the United States did express agreement with the idea, [China responded with massive trade restrictions](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/11/09/australia-china-decoupling-trade-sanctions-coronavirus-geopolitics/) for barley, then beef, then wine, wheat, wool, lobsters, sugar, copper, timber and grapes. Public boycotts were encouraged for coal, cotton and natural gas. So was Australia's move worth it? [China had been responsible for 39.4% of goods exports and 17.6% of services, between 2019 and 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/29/trade-war-with-china-australias-economy-after-covid-19-pandemic.html).

Even if Chinese scientists did concoct COVID-19 in a lab, before accidentally / deliberately leaking it, would the investigation have uncovered it? If the investigation did uncover it, then was that even necessary, for justice to be done? China suffered in the same magnitude as any other nation did, so they would presumably already be motivated to punish those responsible. Even the colleagues of these theoretical lab workers would be motivated to carry out justice − for all we know, those responsible could've encoutered poison in their coffee, in a plot with no involvement from the CIA, the KGB or Spectre.

In trying to attribute blame, some were talking about forcing China to pay reparations, but I think that there is still insufficient acknowledgement that the disease could've arisen anywhere where humans interact with animals. In [this article in the New York Times for instance](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/07/health/omicron-deer-staten-island-covid.html), it's discussed how [15% of deer have caught COVID-19 from humans, but of course, with the rampant speciesism in our world today, there's no mention of whether the disease causes suffering for the deer; nor any possibility of humans making reparations to the deer. The concern of the article is that the deer might act as hosts for mutations of COVID-19 that could spread back to humans.

Bill Gates has been warning of pandemics for years; and gave [this talk in 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Af6b_wyiwI) of how his foundation was preparing for it, yet as we all know, people were somehow surprised that this could happen in 2019. Despite his good deeds, he got labelled as some sort of nefarious supervillain, with various conspiracy theories about wanting to implant everyone with microchips and track them with 5G internet. When good deeds get repaid like that, why wouldn't billionaires spend their money on yachts and spaceships instead?

But back to the COVID origin investigation − for this disease that might as well have arisen anywhere in a culpably underprepared world, what did Australia hope to gain, by directing blame at China? The obvious explanation and seemingly the consensus was that Australian politicians could curry favour with the US. The massive trading revenue with China would be offset by some military goodwill from the US. It's thanks to moves like this that have allowed Australia to [renege on its submarine deals](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/16/france-rebukes-australia-after-it-ditches-submarine-deal-.html) and get access to nuclear submarine technology from the US − a move that, as pointed out by Emmanuel Macron, will make Australia entirely dependent on the US; and depleted in its own sovereignty.

Sure, the submarines would be useful in a military conflict; but we would still need support of the US in a conflict; and this is a dangerous bet. The US has repeatedly shown itself to be an unreliable partner. When Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons in 1991, [it had assurances from the US and Great Britain](https://www.npr.org/2022/02/21/1082124528/ukraine-russia-putin-invasion), that they would not be left to stand alone, should they come under threat. Now they're being invaded and the best that the US can offer is some sanctions − zero troops actually fighting in Ukraine, to protect it. Sure, such a move would risk nuclear war, but that doesn't change the fact that a promise was made and the promise has been broken. The US sees Ukraine less as a sovereign nation that deserves to exist in its own right; and more as a battleground for other people's wars:

>  We’re not perfect — we’re not even close — but we never have walked away.  And Vladimir Putin was counting on being able to split up the United States. 

Look, how would you feel if you saw crowds storm and break down the doors of the British Parliament, kill five cops, injure 145 — or the German Bundestag or the Italian Parliament?  I think you’d wonder.  

Well, that’s what the rest of the world saw.  It’s not who we are.  And now, we’re proving, under pressure, that we are not that country.  We’re united. 

And folks, that’s how I was able — we were able to make sure we kept Europe united and the free world united.  A vote in the United Nations to condemn Putin — 141 countries voted to do that in the U.N. General Assembly.  

Several abstained.  China abstained — didn’t — didn’t vote with them but abstained.  India abstained.  Seven countries abstained — I think it was the number.  They’re alone.  And they did what they did — in my view, he did what he did because he thought he could split NATO, split Europe, and split the United States. 

We’re going to demonstrate to the whole world no one can split this country. − [Joe Biden framing an invasion of Ukraine as an attempt to split the US](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/03/02/remarks-by-president-biden-on-building-a-better-america-2/).

In keeping promises about the defence of Ukraine or anything else, let's not forget that every time the US gets a new president, [they want to refresh relations with Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_withdrawal_from_the_Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action), China, North Korea and Russia. I think this occurrence is symptomatic of the US political structure − by appointing such a central figurehead who's subjected to term limits, they are put in a paradoxical position of being encouraged to leave a legacy, while not having enough time to ensure that the legacy actually lasts.

## Voting Rules
I'm against most controls over who can be in charge; and I find controls such as term limits to be disrespectful to voters' intelligence. If a leader has been around too long, voters can sense for themselves that things are becoming stagnant. So too if the candidate has dual citizenship or even if they're not an Australian citizen at all − voters have the Internet − they should be trusted to judge for themselves whether a candidate's ideas are sufficently *Australian* and whether the candidate can be trusted to look after Australia's best interests. If they need to be explicitly prevented from accidentally voting for a foreigner, then how can they be trusted to vote at all?

Australian politics has suffered [corruption scandal](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10101945/Gladys-Berejiklian-ICAC-Explosive-tape-played-corruption-probe.html) after [corruption scandal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIGKCkS01EA); and anything that allows a faster replacement of incumbent politicians is a way to protect against corruption from spreading. It's a massive disappointment that the party registration requirements were recently changed so that instead of needing 500 members, [parties now need 1,500 members to run in federal elections](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r6755). Notice btw that the parliament website provides no list of who voted to support this bill. Why would they try to be transparent?

* Insurance against cyber attacks is growing in cost exponentially: https://twitter.com/stephsmithio/status/1500990229699698689 − this would indicate that every cost event adds to the pool of further cost events (seems pretty reasonable) − society is woefully backward

* [Sally McManus](https://twitter.com/sallymcmanus) − Secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions
* Secure job by having sex with the boss. Labor in general seems to glorify the notion of having a job, perpetuating the stigma that if you're unemployed, you're a loser. Zero marginal cost existence is so much better. Ho-hum risk avoidance. Public service.

"Secure, well paid jobs" − Greens values. https://greens.org.au/platform.

### Human Rights
The Greens have typicaly presented themselves as the party most concerned with human rights; so it's not surprising for them to list as one of their policies, "An end to all forms of discrimination." − not possible. Being woke is not a policy.

https://greens.org.au/platform/anti-racist-society − "The Greens plan will ensure everyone is treated fairly, by tackling racism and the danger it poses for people of colour. " − is racism not dangerous to white people too? This sort of speech is replicating the identity politics of the US; and this speech is being strongly opposed in France for instance, where black members of the football team had to call out Trevor Noah, who had joked to his American audience that considering how many French players are black, "did Africa just win the world cup?"

> Unlike the United States of America, France does not refer to their citizens based on their race, religion or origin. To us, there is no hyphenated identity, roots are an individual reality. By calling them an African team, it seems you are denying their Frenchness. This, even in jest, legitimizes the ideology which claims whiteness as the only definition of being French.” − Gérard Araud is not like other ambassadors. The French envoy to the US
the French victory in the 2018 world cup was really a win for Africa. These black players publicly told Noah,  https://qz.com/1331734/trevor-noahs-world-cup-joke-shows-how-the-world-misunderstands-the-french/ 
* It's great to care about human rights, but there just aren't any incentive structures there to make it last. Goodwill runs out.
* Taxing billionaires − this isn't a feasible long-term plan. Why are these billionaires going to stay? How are we supposed to generate new ones?  When these people are represented, there's a grey tinge about them, like they're corpses. It's tapping into the age-old, discriminatory trope that ugly people are bad; and good people are attractive. I thought they just said they wanted to end all forms of discrimination?

I agree with The Greens' point that when big corporations pay no tax, it's a sign that they're probably gaming the system and it's probably unfair. I would instinctually like for global sanctions to be placed on such leeches on society; and it's a good sign when the OECD recently came to an agreement that there would be a [global, minimum tax rate of 15%](https://www.oecd.org/tax/beps/oecd-releases-pillar-two-model-rules-for-domestic-implementation-of-15-percent-global-minimum-tax.htm)

When everyone pays their fair share of tax, we have enough funds to ensure that all citizens are treated with dignity, even i they're down on their luck. We have enough funds to help those abroad too, becoming a good global citizen and earning influence through benevolent means, rather than through military adventures.

While this idea of enabling a dignified life might sound like "Universal Basic Income", I actually think we can do better than that; and aim for *zero marginal-cost existence* − that is, the cost of adding a new, fully participating citizen into our society, would cost $0 eventually, due to cost reductions in electricity, food and shelter. I believe that such a model provides a slightly better alignment of incentives than UBI; and it's also more compelling to existing citizens who might be wealthier and who are not worried about the job-insurance idea of UBI. Zero marginal-cost existence is relevant to anyone who's paying the cost of *living*.

Government should be playing a part in software, eg Sweden offering the solution for travelling salesman. Liberal party doesn't understand software, eg Google & Facebook fiasco. International embarassment.
