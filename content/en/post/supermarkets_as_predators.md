In the ongoing circus of the "_cost of living crisis_", the latest target of public scorn is the grocery business.
Although it's true that Australians are under economic strain, the “cost of living" catch-cry has been a useful
political football for targeting anything from housing to beer
to [petrol](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-30/soaring-petrol-prices-leading-people-to-make-tough-calls/102906648).

Let's point out that Liberal and Labor have both participated in the decades-long inflation of the housing market, to
the point where house prices are
now [121 times](https://www.statista.com/statistics/591796/house-price-to-income-ratio-australia/) the disposable
income.

> [Global house prices: The Economist](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2017/03/09/global-house-prices)

[Across 2023](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-01-24/cost-of-living-climbing-faster-than-weve-been-told/103380312), the
price of food only climbed 4.8%, compared to the price of mortgage interest charges rising 68%.

But putting aside the biggest contributor to the cost of living, let's return our focus to groceries − the dominance of
the industry by just two profit-driven companies can't be good, surely?

People might publicly say that it's a bad thing, but Woolworths had
[374,275 shareholders as of November 2022](https://capital.com/woolworths-group-shareholder-who-owns-most-wow-stock#:~:text=According%20to%20Woolworths%2C%20there%20were%20374%2C275%20WOW%20shareholders%2C,for%20seven%20per%20cent%20of%20issued%20share%20capital),
and it's not like they're going to say out loud “let's keep squeezing shoppers, employees and the environment."

Even for shoppers, although they say that the system is unfair and that they're being squeezed, do they care about the
supermarkets also squeezing employees, farmers, chickens, or [orangutans](https://orangutan.org/palmoil/)?

Our entire economy is built on exploiting each other. Much of the supermarket is stocked with products that are _not only_
unethical in their production, they make us unhealthy and unhappy when we consume them. Coca Cola has
[more sugar than orange juice](https://foodstruct.com/compare/orange-juice-vs-coca-cola), and even then, the orange
juice has more sugar than it would have had in the past.

When sugar cane was made available to Europe, it was part of being hospitable to offer sugar water to guests. The
pineapple was prized for its sweetness compared to European fruits, and the ultimate mark of hospitality was to offer
slices of pineapple to guests. If you couldn't afford to serve pineapple, you could rent a pineapple as a feature for
the table, and to this day, the fruit serves as a popular motif in hospitality.

The agriculture industry has been progressively growing cows that produce more milk; chickens that grow faster; and
fruit that grows bigger and sweeter. When the saying was coined “an apple a day keeps the doctor away", it was talking
about what was arguably a different fruit altogether.

Such agricultural development may come as a rude shock to the current wave of consumers (especially Americans) who have
been sold the idea that genetic modification of food is some sort of evil, inferior product. In fact, developments like
[Golden Rice](https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/population-health/divisions-sections-centers/medical-ethics/education/high-school-bioethics-project/learning-scenarios/gmos-the-golden-rice-debate#:~:text=Golden%20rice%20is%20a%20genetically%20modified%2C%20biofortified%20crop.,vitamin%20A%20when%20metabolized%20by%20the%20human%20body.)
are able to resolve nutrient deficiencies for millions of people in poorer nations. The improvements in
wheat production by [Norman Borlaug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug) are credited with saving a **_billion_**
people from famine. He was awarded the Nobel Peace
Prize in 1970.

When Sri Lanka decided
to [ban fertiliser](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/fertiliser-ban-decimates-sri-lankan-crops-government-popularity-ebbs-2022-03-03/)
and rely on organic farming in 2022, people starved and the government was
overthrown.

We needn't stop now, in the application of science to food production. We are needlessly letting animals suffer in live
exports and even if they _did_ live happy lives, their impact on climate change is enormous − food production for humans
is ultimately responsible for 26% of greenhouse gas emissions, and beef
is [far and away](https://ourworldindata.org/environmental-impacts-of-food#:~:text=used%20for%20agriculture.-,Food%20is%20responsible%20for%20one%2Dquarter%20of%20the%20world's%20emissions,of%20global%20greenhouse%20gas%20emissions.&text=This%20includes%20emissions%20from%20land,transport%2C%20packaging%2C%20and%20retail.)

Populist sycophants
like [Bev McArthur from the Liberal Party](https://twitter.com/BevMcArthurMP/status/1760081254983270611) are complaining
that she's expected to stop eating beef, as though it's some sort of god-given right to eat it. Why does the US amend
its constitution to protect free speech and guns, but not eating beef? How are people expected to really _live_?

It might come as a surprise to such gourmets that in
fact, [cows were invented in ~8,500 BC](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2012/mar/dna-traces-cattle-back-small-herd-domesticated-around-10500-years-ago)
and
have [progressively been bred](https://www.quora.com/What-was-very-useful-when-it-first-came-out-but-is-useless-today/answer/Owen-Miller-3)
to be more docile and tasty. In the Epic of Gilgamesh, The Bull of Heaven was sent to
kill the warrior king, Gilgamesh. Now there are cows that are so totally dependent on humans that they queue up every
day to be milked at the industrial production line.

[Impossible Foods](https://impossiblefoods.com/) has proven that it's possible to develop proteins in a lab that are
commercially popular, even amongst
customers who aren't vegetarian. At Burger King, customers can purchase
the [Impossible Whopper](https://impossiblefoods.com/burgerking), which looks a whole lot
tastier than Bev's excuse for a salad.

We can keep growing more foods in labs, through a process known
as [precision fermentation](https://www.csiro.au/en/news/All/Articles/2022/January/whats-brewing-precision-fermentation).
Besides saving time and
energy, it obviously frees up an enormous expanse of land too − agriculture currently accounts for [50% of the world's
habitable land](https://ourworldindata.org/environmental-impacts-of-food#:~:text=used%20for%20agriculture.-,Food%20is%20responsible%20for%20one%2Dquarter%20of%20the%20world's%20emissions,of%20global%20greenhouse%20gas%20emissions.&text=This%20includes%20emissions%20from%20land,transport%2C%20packaging%2C%20and%20retail.),
and [70% of freshwater withdrawal](https://ourworldindata.org/environmental-impacts-of-food#:~:text=used%20for%20agriculture.-,Food%20is%20responsible%20for%20one%2Dquarter%20of%20the%20world's%20emissions,of%20global%20greenhouse%20gas%20emissions.&text=This%20includes%20emissions%20from%20land,transport%2C%20packaging%2C%20and%20retail.).
Did you know that livestock makes up [62% of mammal biomass](https://ourworldindata.org/wild-mammals-birds-biomass),
with wild
mammals only making up 4%?

The only thing holding us back from progress here is consumer whims. As far back as Adam Smith, it's been accepted that
our economy is dependent on people exploiting each other in an intertwined mesh, ultimately serving the whims of the
bourgeoisie:

> _The rich only select from the heap what is most precious and agreeable. They consume little more than the poor, and
in spite of their natural selfishness and rapacity, though they mean only their own conveniency, though the sole end
which they propose from the labours of all the thousands whom they employ, be the gratification of their own vain and
insatiable desires, they divide with the poor the produce of all their improvements._
> 
> _They are led by an invisible hand
to make nearly the same distribution of the necessaries of life, which would have been made, had the earth been divided
into equal portions among all its inhabitants, and thus without intending it, without knowing it, advance the interest
of the society, and afford means to the multiplication of the species._
>
> [The Theory of Moral Sentiments](https://nonhuman.party/post/replacing_capitalism/), Adam Smith, 1759.

Upon visiting the supermarket and its apparently extortionist pricing, we established earlier that it's full of immoral,
unhealthy junk. So the claim that two companies have cornered the market for such products seems somewhat of a moot
point.

If the Australian government were truly interested in how Australians are fed, it would be making tools and information
more easily accessible to consumers, to help them make beneficial choices. For years of our childhood, many Australians
would've eaten grains and sugar for breakfast, in the form of Corn Flakes or Rice Bubbles. On the side of the box was
the [food pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_pyramid_(nutrition)), declaring how much we should eat from
various food groups.

> ![The original food pyramid](/images/supermarket_article/food_pyramid.webp)

This pyramid wasn't developed by physicians or even by
aliens. [It was developed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_pyramid_(nutrition)) by the US Department of Agriculture.
What should you eat? Well, whatever we're growing!

Imagine if the government made itself more useful in people's lives and helped them stay healthy. We could for instance
fund a meal tracker that tracks energy, protein, and all the minerals for life. The government could apply the principle
of [dirigisme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirigisme) and establish a company
manufacturing [smart toilets](https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2020/04/smart-toilet-monitors-for-signs-of-disease.html)
that analyse the composition of things when food comes out the other end.

Already, wearable computing is at the stage where it can detect disease before humans even notice their symptoms. The
reason it's not more popular is because there's so little money in keeping people healthy. How can you spend money on
R&D and marketing, telling _consumers_ that in the best case, they won't notice anything. The way to make money is to
wait for them to get sick, then milk them for treatment.

Go to any US hospital and you'll see vending machines for cola and potato chips. The opioid crisis in the US was a
result of _legal_ opioids being over-prescribed to treat any pain, turning ordinary people into drug addicts, ultimately
causing deaths at the same scale as the COVID pandemic:

> ![A chart showing the opiod epidemic in the US](/images/unabomber_article/opiod_waves.webp)
> [Opiod overdoses](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/epidemic/index.html) in the US are on the same scale as COVID deaths.

## Conclusion

When Australians complain about being exploited at the supermarket, the sad reality is that they've been tricked into
buying junk that's undermining their health, and in purchasing this junk, they're guilty of exploitation themselves.

It doesn't have to be like this. The government is sitting idly by, relying on the free market to solve everything, even
though the free market is not incentivised to keep the environment healthy, or even
_**to keep its own customers healthy**_. It's a community effort to grow our collective wisdom and to look out for each
other. If we feel it's a right of citizens to be fed and to be housed in a liveable climate, then the logical conclusion
is the gradual introduction of a [Universal Basic Income](https://basicincomeaustralia.com/) and public incentives for the research & development of
precision fermentation.

If we feel that citizens need help in keeping track of their health, then the logical path forward is for the government
to [fund open-source software](../replacing_capitalism/) that tracks our meals, tracks our health and helps us to live
our best lives.

The markets are effective at some things − we should definitely have a competition of ideas, but when the market's only
measure of success is GDP, then it's inevitably going to lead to these perverse outcomes. Let's not buy into the
simplistic media narrative that the _cost of living crisis_ was invented by Anthony Albanese, and that it can be resolved
by making room in the grocery business for some new, benevolent company who's more likely to sell Australia Day merch.
