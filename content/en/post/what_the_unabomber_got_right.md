description: "Industrial Society is full of surrogate activities"
author: "Owen Miller"

From 1978 to 1995, the [Freedom Club (FC) sent bombs through the mail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kaczynski), to universities and airlines, triggering an FBI investigation named UNABOM.

In an agreement that would end the bombings, the "*manifesto*" of the Freedom Club, ***Industrial Society and its Future***, was published in the [New York Times](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/national/unabom-manifesto-1.html) and the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/unabomber/manifesto.text.htm) in 1995.

The goal of Theodore Kaczynski and the Freedom Club was to tear down modern technology, so that society could return to a dignified, free existence, comparable to 1800s frontier society in the US. It was argued that industrial society is all-consuming and constantly encroaching, so people couldn't ever choose to have just some of it.

The essay makes some compelling points about the meaning of life and the structure of our society; and was clearly formulated over many years of thought, by a man with a strong academic background. I think it's intellectually dishonest that the common response to Kaczynski is simply that the essay is a "*manifesto*" of a crazy person; and therefore it doesn't justify debate. It's logically coherent and free of any contradictions (at least, in my interpretation) − *something that cannot be said for every current, popular world-view being followed*.

After reading the essay recently, it was puzzling to me why it didn't attract more followers − why haven't we seen anyone else joining the Freedom Club and bringing down airlines for instance? It's not like airlines do a great job at keeping their passengers happy or even treating them like human beings. I suspect that the vast majority of people just never read the essay, then the next largest group is the aforementioned "*people who read the essay, but dismissed it as crazy and not worthy of debate*". *The Unabomber is a terrorist, therefore he's wrong*.

## Surrogate Activities
The central argument of Kaczynski / FC is that modern life is meaningless; and people must adopt "*surrogate activities*" to avoid depression and hopelessness. Such a theme is echoed by psychologist Eric Fromm in his 1941 work, *[Escape from Freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_from_Freedom)*, where he argues that since it's no longer a challenge to stay alive, our natural threshold of fear goes unsatisfied and drives us insane, unless we become alcoholics; workaholics; or generally distract ourselves in some way from the overwhelming amount of freedom we have.

Kaczynski's response to the overbearing freedom is to purge technology so that we'll again have a challenging life where it's difficult to stay alive and where we'll be able to fulfill our psychological "*power struggle*" − he himself moved to a cabin without electricity or water.

> ![Ted Kaczynski stands outside his cabin near Lincoln, Montana, in June 1972](/images/unabomber_article/cabin.png)
> Ted Kaczynski stands outside his cabin near Lincoln, Montana, in June 1972.

> Even if most people in industrial-technological society were well satisfied, we (FC) would still be opposed to that form of society, because (among other reasons) we consider it demeaning to fulfill one's need for the power process through surrogate activities or through identification with an organization, rather than through pursuit of real goals.

It's debatable for me whether keeping oneself alive *the hard way* is a *real* goal, but anyway, it's hard to deny that many people absorb into their identity, their love of some particular group. Maybe even a group that's pursuing a *surrogate activity*, like a sporting team.

If we consider "useful jobs", then that's still no safe-haven from criticism − [Price's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_J._de_Solla_Price#Scientific_contributions) finds that 50% of the productive work in a population is done by the square root of the population. In a company of 100, there will be ***10 people producing just as much as the other 90***!! This law alone implies that many people must have bullshit, meaningless jobs.

> Imagine a society that subjects people to conditions that make them terribly unhappy, then gives them drugs to take away their unhappiness. Science fiction? It is already happening to some extent in our own society.

> ![A chart showing the opiod epidemic in the US](/images/unabomber_article/opiod_waves.png)
> [Opiod overdoses](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/epidemic/index.html) in the US are on the same scale as COVID deaths.

It is hard to argue against Kaczynski's claim that many modern humans live meaningless lives, but I disagree with how he classifies *real goals* vs *surrogate activities*. His most debatable classification is when he discusses why scientists are motivated in their work:
> The "benefit of humanity" explanation doesn't work any better. Some scientific work has no conceivable relation to the welfare of the human race most of archaeology or comparative linguistics for example. Some other areas of science present obviously dangerous possibilities. Yet scientists in these areas are just as enthusiastic about their work as those who develop vaccines or study air pollution.

It's really two claims he's making here:
### 1. Curiosity Isn't Really Fulfilling
In his 1943 paper, *[A Theory of Human Motivation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs)*, psychologist Abraham Maslow identified a ranking of psychological desires that humans feel compelled to conquer:

![Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs](/images/unabomber_article/Maslow.png)

If we were to return to frontier society with nothing more advanced than a blacksmith, then we'd arguably be stuck in the *deficiency needs* section of the pyramid. Kacyzski agrees that later goals are happening, but that they just don't count as ***real*** goals. On this distinction, I don't feel that he provides adequate justification; and I have the view that self-actualisation is indeed a real goal. Kaczynski talks about evolution and natural selection; that academic pursuits are not biologically ingrained in us, but I feel that such goals were always there and that we just haven't been able to satisfy the earlier needs, so few people ever got to the stage of thinking much about transcendence.

### 2. Advancement of the Human Race Isn't a Real Goal
I would perhaps go as far as inserting an extra need into Maslow's pyramid: *the need for the advancement of mankind*, which I'd put just below *Transcedence*. There is an undeniably large population who express concern for the survival of the planet; and for the powerful who aren't part of this group, [they often seem more interested in greed](../voting_fusion), so these powerful people might not actually be at the stage of self-actualisation − their contributions are only going to enrich themselves and not really leave a mark as a great thinker or someone who society would be proud of.

Of course, it's possible that my identification with any pro-environment or pro-humanity agenda is because I'm a raging leftist:

> The leftist seeks to satisfy his need for power through identification with a social movement and he tries to go through the power process by helping to pursue and attain the goals of the movement (see paragraph 83). But no matter how far the movement has gone in attaining its goals the leftist is never satisfied, because his activism is a surrogate activity (see paragraph 41). That is, the leftist's real motive is not to attain the ostensible goals of leftism; in reality he is motivated by the sense of power he gets from struggling for and then reaching a social goal.

Another perspective on the need to advance mankind is the [Gaia Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_hypothesis) of chemist James Lovelock. The theory is that the world is a self-regulating system, with its various organisms inadvertently serving a higher purpose of keeping the Earth alive, for the eventual creation of superintelligent beings, probably robots. In this theory, humans are the creators of the superintelligent robots (or at least, the precursor robots).

The world has indeed evolved from the early [thermo-acido-philic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria) and [methanogenic bacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methanogenic_bacteria) towards the oxygen-enriched atmosphere today that supports more complex life. The ensuing [Great Oxidation Event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxidation_Event) resulted in the Oxygen-producing cyanobacteria causing the mass exctinction of [Paleoproterozoic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleoproterozoic) organisms; and it also cooled the planet.

By Lovelock's hypothesis, our progression towards superintelligent AI is a goal of Gaia (and therefore as natural as the evolution of apes to humans); whereas Kacyznski feel the creation of superintelligent AIs is *unnatural* and undesirable:

> As society and the problems that face it become more and more complex and as machines become more and more intelligent, people will let machines make more and more of their decisions for them, simply because machine-made decisions will bring better results than man-made ones. Eventually a stage may be reached at which the decisions necessary to keep the system running will be so complex that human beings will be incapable of making them intelligently. At that stage the machines will be in effective control. People won't be able to just turn the machine off, because they will be so dependent on them that turning them off would amount to suicide.

Here, Kaczynski makes a compelling prediction of the future that has similarities in [Cloud Atlas](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1371111/) and perhaps [Black Mirror](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2085059/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1). For me, it's a much more convincing scenario than the idea of killer robots getting out of control; a theory [being pushed in the UN](https://theconversation.com/un-fails-to-agree-on-killer-robot-ban-as-nations-pour-billions-into-autonomous-weapons-research-173616).

Although I see it as plausible, I also think that it's avoidable: it has been described in [*Keeping Governments Relevant in the Web3 Era*](../keeping_governments_relevant_in_web3_era/), how open-source software can allow end users to collaborate in the wide-reaching systems powering society. If they wanted less involvement in the system, then the advances in software and robotics are allowing greater self-suffciency, through the use of robotic assistants. I have a broad interpretation of what it means to be a *cyborg* and I would see exoskeletons and brain implants to be not too different to the use of a wristwatch; a calendar; or even a pair of socks. I'd be surprised if Kaczynski wasn't wearing socks, in his isolated cabin.

If the advancement of humanity was not a *real goal* and did not exist in my proposed spot within Maslow's Hierarchy, then it would imply that someone could reach the top of the pyramid, to [Übermensch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9Cbermensch) status, while holding a desire to destroy the world, like [The Joker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(character)) perhaps. But where is such a character? The evil geniuses we see in James Bond or the Powerpuff Girls just don't exist in the real world.

By contrast, improving the world; and even building new worlds, is a phenomenally popular activity. Sim City; The Sims; Spore; and Eve Online were all [sensationally popular games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_PC_games), paving the way for more modern titles like Second Life and Animal Crossing.

> ![Charlie XCX and Troye Sivan dancing in a house resembling one from the original Sims game, released in 2000](/images/unabomber_article/Sims.gif)

By playing world-building games, does it inspire people and move them towards self-actualisation; or is it a downward-spiral depression mechanism, like sleeping all day?


## Industrial Society is Not Serving Human Needs
Kaczynski disparages economic growth as a pointless goal that diverges from human needs. Humans are meant to be protected by constitutional rights, but such rights are bourgeois conception of freedom:
> According to the bourgeois conception, a "*free*" man is essentially an element of a social machine and has only a certain set of prescribed and delimited freedoms; freedoms that are designed to serve the needs of the social machine more than those of the individual. Thus the bourgeois's "free" man has economic freedom because that promotes growth and progress; he has freedom of the press because public criticism restrains misbehavior by political leaders; he has a right to a fair trial because imprisonment at the whim of the powerful would be bad for the system. This was clearly the attitude of [Simon Bolivar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sim%C3%B3n_Bol%C3%ADvar). To him, people deserved liberty only if they used it to promote progress (progress as conceived by the bourgeois).

Not only is the system disrespectful to human rights, it's disrespectful to the environment:
> It is not at all certain that survival of the system will lead to less suffering than breakdown of the system would. The system has already caused, and is continuing to cause, immense suffering all over the world. Ancient cultures, that for hundreds of years gave people a satisfactory relationship with each other and with their environment, have been shattered by contact with industrial society, and the result has been a whole catalogue of economic, environmental, social and psychological problems.

## What Starts as Optional, Becomes Less So
Kaczynski argues that we can't have *just a bit* of technology, because it has a habit of encroaching uninvited throughout society:

> When motor vehicles were introduced they appeared to increase man's freedom. They took no freedom away from the walking man, no one had to have an automobile if he didn't want one, and anyone who did choose to buy an automobile could travel much faster and farther than a walking man. But the introduction of motorized transport soon changed society in such a way as to restrict greatly man's freedom of locomotion.
>
> When automobiles became numerous, it became necessary to regulate their use extensively. In a car, especially in densely populated areas, one cannot just go where one likes at one's own pace; one's movement is governed by the flow of traffic and by various traffic laws. One is tied down by various obligations: license requirements, driver test, renewing registration, insurance, maintenance required for safety, monthly payments on purchase price. Moreover, the use of motorized transport is no longer optional.
>
> Since the introduction of motorized transport the arrangement of our cities has changed in such a way that the majority of people no longer live within walking distance of their place of employment, shopping areas and recreational opportunities, so that they HAVE TO depend on the automobile for transportation. Or else they must use public transportation, in which case they have even less control over their own movement than when driving a car. Even the walker's freedom is now greatly restricted. In the city he continually has to stop to wait for traffic lights that are designed mainly to serve auto traffic. In the country, motor traffic makes it dangerous and unpleasant to walk along the highway.

It's easy to agree that in much of the anglophone Western world, your participation in society depends on a car. In this chart from [City Monitor](https://citymonitor.ai/government/infrastructure/towards-the-30-minute-city-how-australians-commutes-compare-with-cities-overseas), we can see the full extent of the problem − for its population, Sydney and Melbourne are more walkable / cyclable than their North-American counterparts, but nowhere close to China or continental Europe. As explained by [Climate Town](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfsCniN7Nsc), car-dependent suburban sprawl is uneconomical to maintain and results in a poor quality of life.

Since Kaczynski's essay in 1995, we can also see how email addresses have become required (*how good is email btw* 💕💌💞); and in South Korea, even plastic surgery is now *required*. In this documentary, we see that even to get a job as a marketer, a straight man feels pressured into getting plastic surgery:

{{< youtube 8PlaqfnNLFA >}}

Kaczynski argues that it's naïve to think that we can phase out technology smoothly; and that "technophiles" will fight stubbornly at every step. We can see that this is very much true for fossil fuels; and [even for radon makeup](../embracing_evil_technolgy), people were still using it, while knowing that it probably wasn't so good for their long-term health. Going by Kaczynski's logic, we should only predict an increase in the popularity of plastic surgery in South Korea.

Perhaps we can agree with Kaczynski that technological *change* is inevitable; and that it's hard to resist it. Those who oppose it inevitably get stepped on; and afterwards, [it's not like anybody has any sympathy for those who got in the way](../embracing_evil_technolgy/).

## Technological Progress Impacts Traditional Values
> The conservatives are fools: They whine about the decay of traditional values, yet they enthusiastically support technological progress and economic growth. Apparently it never occurs to them that you can’t make rapid, drastic changes in the technology and the economy of a society without causing rapid changes in all other aspects of the society as well, and that such rapid changes inevitably break down traditional values.

Perhaps the most relatable example of technology enabling a breakdown of values is when it comes to reproductive biology. By giving women the power to readily avoid pregnancy, the contraceptive pill allowed women to have multiple sexual partners without being caught; and even if they stayed faithful, they could delay their decision to "fully commit" (by having a child). Email allows women to easily tell their friends that they're in an abusive relationship and that they're having trouble escaping; and computer vision could take it one step further, detecting people in abusive relationships without them explicitly having to emit messages from a potentially compromised computing device.

## The System Gradually Removes Freedoms


## Conclusion

When we explored earlier how world-building games tap into the arguably fundamental human urge to advance humanity, the exploration was cut perhaps prematurely, but now having considered a fuller scope of Kaczynski's insight, let's explore the world-building a bit more. In his 1972 work, [*The Gods Themselves*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gods_Themselves), Isaac Asimov tells the story of a world where there are two prominent races − a long-living rock-like race; and a blob-like race with a short lifespan. The blob race has three sexes who typically form three-way relationships. ***Spoiler alert*** The three-way blob couples can evolve into the rock race, but only if they give birth; and only if they themselves realise (*without being told!*) that they can evolve into the rock race through some sort of orgasm / concentration experience.

Could it be that world-building is an ingrained human trait, because we're living in a simulation and the only way to escape it is to realise that we can become gods?

Whether we're living in a simulation or not, we should be able to agree that advancing humanity is an innate desire that *most people* find themselves unable to achieve. Therefore a society which gives people the tools to *advance humanity* will enable its population to move up the hierarchy of needs, freeing them from the opiod-inducing nihilism of modern society. The modern world is run on software, so giving people tools to advance humanity means enabling them to contribute to open-source software.

New technology is going to consume our lives anyway, so governments have a responsibility to empower its citizens to play a part in the creation of this new technology. We urgently need to amass citizens into steering the path of technological progress towards a productive goal, and not towards a depression-inducing Big Brother that we cannot unplug.

If Australia continues on the path it's on, we'll end up becoming irrelevant in the modern world and our days will be consumed bickering over *who's more woke*. Do you want that; or do you want to create the future? *Fulfill your innate desires and* ***become your full self!*** *Spread the word of the Non-Human Party!*


## Unused
* A solution is to have more ways for people to genuinely help the world, through eg open-source projects, rather than wasting their time fighting for woke intersectionality. In nations without this, society will tear itself apart.
* Reach out to Jordan Peterson about how the "intersectional" folk are perfectly summarised by this; and how we can improve the world.

What if we're meant to become a god, to prove that we're the worthy one to be released from the simulation?

If we were travelling to a new planet, to keep our species alive, then it could take millenia, so we'd need to keep people entertained on the trip. Why not go all-out and create a simulation? Then we need people to build a society when we arrive, so we might as well judge the people in the simulation. Why is it that it's so easy for us to imagine gods existing; and us creating gods? It must be an inherently deep, biological trait that evolution has developed in us. Either it's through Gaia or natural selection of just humans, but either way, what if we embrace it − what if we try to become gods?

This is just like Isaac Asimov's book, where those who evolve into the higher species necessarily need to become aware that they're in a sort of trial / simulation.

In https://open.spotify.com/episode/1YXmEWV13ov9PoU1tfUPWr, at ~5:00, Troles Schönfeldt claims that we can't solve global warming without nuclear power. Perhaps we can frame global warming as an evolutionary hurdle that is pushing us into nuclear power, so that we can in turn have enough energy to create superhuman AI and migrate to new planets?
